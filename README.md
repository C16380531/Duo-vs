OOP Assignment


### Overview of Project

We, team Duo-Vs, for this OOP assignment have submitted a series of two player games ran from a computer console. It includes the following games: Connect 4, Dots and Boxes, Pong, Checkers, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Breakout. 

With six games, and six members, each game was taken by an individual member. However, when problems occurred, we of course helped each other to solve the problems that laid in front of us. Hence, the overall project was very much an evenly divided project in terms of workload. 

Each game is connected through a Game State which provides the user with a menu through which they can scroll through and choose the game they desire to play. The menu provides a photographic image of the game and also when clicked will show a description of the game in question. Once in each game, the user can choose to play or can return to the menu through a ‘Back’ button we included. The user can also exit the the whole program through an ‘Exit’ button in the menu. 

We created a Handler class, KeyManager class, and MouseManager class so that each member could access these classes hence avoiding the same code from being written out twice, thus avoiding redundant code.
